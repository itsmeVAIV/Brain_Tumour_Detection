# Brain_Tumour_Detection
üß† Brain Tumor Detection System
This project is a deep learning-based web application designed to detect brain tumors from MRI images using the VGG16 Convolutional Neural Network model. The frontend is built using Flask, allowing users to easily upload brain scan images and receive fast, accurate predictions on the presence of a tumor.
